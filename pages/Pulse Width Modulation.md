- # Pulse Width Modulation
- ## Definition
- *Pulse width modulation* (PWM) is a technique used to encode a value into the **width (duration)** of digital pulses in a periodic signal.
- A **microcontroller's GPIO** pin can be configured to output a square wave where the **high time** (pulse width) varies, while the **period** remains constant.
- ## Implementation
- The na√Øve way to implement PWM in software using loops, but since this approach will make it hard to also have the CPU perform other tasks a better option is to rely on a [[timer]] [[peripheral]] commonly part of microcontrollers.
