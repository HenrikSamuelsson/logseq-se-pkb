Title:: Freestanding Environment in C
Term:: Freestanding Environment
Source:: C Standard (e.g., ISO/IEC 9899)

- ## 🧩 Definition
  A *freestanding environment* is a programming environment where only a minimal subset of the C Standard Library and language features are guaranteed to be available.
- Typically used in embedded systems, kernel development, bootloaders, and bare-metal programs.
- Unlike a full desktop application, it does not assume the existence of an operating system, file system, or complex runtime support.
- ## 🛠 Minimal Requirements
  In a freestanding environment the compiler must support:
	- All the core language features (syntax, types, operators, etc.)
	- Some minimal headers like [[float.h]], [[imits.h]], [[stdarg.h]], [[stddef.h]], and [[iso646.h]].
- In a freestanding environment the following are optional or absent:
	- File I/O (fopen, printf, etc.)
	- Standard library functions ([[malloc]], [[free]], [[exit]], etc.)
	- The full runtime environment (main() could even be non-standard) The program might start execution from a custom function like Reset_Handler() instead of main().
- ## 🧠 Examples of Freestanding Systems
- System Freestanding? Notes
  Bootloader ✅ No OS, minimal startup code
  Embedded firmware ✅ Direct hardware access
  Operating system kernel ✅ Initializes hardware manually
  Desktop app ❌ Uses hosted environment features
- ## 📌 C Standard Reference
  “A freestanding environment is one in which standard library facilities may be limited or absent, and in which startup and termination are implementation-defined.”
- ([[C11 standard]], Section 4.1.5)
- ## 🚀 Why It Matters
  You must often write your own [[memory management]], [[I/O drivers]], or [[startup code]].
- Cannot rely on functions like [[printf]] or [[malloc]] unless you implement or port them.
- Helps you think carefully about [[resource usage]] and [[initialization]] in [[embedded systems]].
