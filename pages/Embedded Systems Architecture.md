	- ## Full Title
	- Embedded Systems Architecture: Design and write software for embedded devices to build safe and connected systems, Second Edition
	- ## Description
	  The book starts with an brief introduction to embedded systems and aids in setting up a development environment. Then various basic embedded systems topics are discussed such as [[peripherals]], [[connectivity]], and [[energy efficiency]]. Later parts of the book discusses more complex systems incorporating a [[real-time operating system]].
