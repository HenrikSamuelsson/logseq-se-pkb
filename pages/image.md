# Image
- ## ✏️ Definition
- An image* is a compiled output of a program that contains all the machine code and data needed to run on the target hardware.
- ## 📦Contents
- An image may include:
	- Executable code (.text section)
	- Initialized data (.data)
	- Uninitialized data placeholders (.bss)
	- Vector tables, interrupt handlers, etc.
- ## 🧱 Image Formats
- There are several different image formats for different use cases, for example:
	- `.elf`: Executable and Linkable Format (rich in debug info)
	- `.bin`: Raw binary image (just the memory contents, no metadata)
	- `.hex`: Intel HEX format (text-based, for use with many [[flash tools]])
- ## 🛠 In Practice
- During build: The compiler and linker produce an `.elf` file.
- For flashing: You convert that `.elf` to a `.bin` or `.hex` *image*.
- When writing docs: “Firmware image” often means “the thing you flash to your board.”
