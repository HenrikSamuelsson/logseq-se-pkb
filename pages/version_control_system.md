- # Version Control System
- ## Definition
- A *version control system* (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to files over time.
- ## Benefits
- Version control systems enables developers to revert to earlier versions, view the history of changes (including who made them and why), and annotate changes with comments to explain their purpose. VCSs also support branching and merging, allowing team members to work independently on different features and later integrate their work. The field of software development relies heavily on version control systems to manage source code and documentation efficiently.
- ## Examples
- [[Git]]
- [[SVN]]
- [[Mercurial]]
