	- ## ðŸ“– Definition
	- A *real-time system* is one in which tasks are guaranteed to execute within a defined and predictable time constraint. This deterministic behaviour ensures that critical operations occur within their deadlines, often within milliseconds, making the system appear highly responsiveâ€”especially important in time-sensitive applications.
