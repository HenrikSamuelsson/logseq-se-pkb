Functional requirements define **what a system should do**. They describe specific behaviors, functions, or features the system must provide to meet user needs.

They often include:

- Business rules
- Transactions
- User interactions
- System responses
- Data handling and transformations
  
  Functional requirements are usually captured in:
- [[Use Cases]]
- [[User Stories]]
- [[Functional Specifications]]
  
  They are distinct from [[Non-Functional Requirements]], which describe *how* the system performs (e.g., speed, reliability, usability).
