- Functional requirements define **what a system should do**. They describe specific behaviours, functions, or features the system must provide to meet user needs.
- *Example*: "The system shall send a confirmation email to the user after successful registration."
- They often include:
	- [[Business rules]]
	- Transactions
	- User interactions
	- System responses
	- Data handling and transformations
- They are usually captured in:
	- [[Use Cases]]
	- [[User Stories]]
	- [[Functional Specifications]]
- They are distinct from [[Non-Functional Requirements]], which describe **how** the system performs (e.g., speed, reliability, usability).
