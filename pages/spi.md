	- # SPI
	- ## Main Idea  
	  **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)** is a simple, [[full-duplex]] communication protocol commonly used to transfer data between a [[microcontroller]] and one or more external peripheral devices, such as sensors, displays, or memory chips. It operates using a [[master-slave architecture]], where the microcontroller typically acts as the master and initiates communication via clock and data lines.
