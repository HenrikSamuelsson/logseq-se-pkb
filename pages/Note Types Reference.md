- ## List of Note Types
- `[[fleeting_note]]`
	- Temporary, quick thoughts or ideas.
	- Often messy and unstructured.
	- Use these as a scratchpad.
- `[[index_note]]`
	- A special note that serves as a directory to major areas or topics in your graph.
	- Think of it as the table of contents.
- `[[literature_note]]`
	- Notes taken from books, papers, or other sources.
	- These often serve as the foundation for future permanent notes.
- `[[overview_note]]`
	- Provides a summary or high-level view of a topic.
	- Often directly linked from the [[Index]] or from topic categories like SWEBOK areas.
- `[[permanent_note]]`
	- Core, long-term notes with synthesized ideas in your own words.
	- These are the backbone of your knowledge base.
- `[[reference_note]]`
	- A general-purpose note used to define terms, list standards, or summarize meta-information.
	- This very note that you're reading now is an example!
- `[[source_note]]`

	- Helps keep source material organized and referenceable.
