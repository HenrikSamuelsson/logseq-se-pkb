- **Full Title**:  
  *Embedded Expert's Guide to C: The Secrets to becoming a Reliable Embedded C Expert*
- **Description**:  
  This isn't another book on how to write C - it's a book on how not to write C. And that's something the world desperately does need, because despite its enduring popularity, many programmers remain blissfully unaware of the issues C has or how to avoid them.
  
  This book assumes you can already write C the way all those other books tell you to do it. Its purpose is not to repeat what you already know, but to reveal some of the nuances, curiosities and outright absurdities of the language that are all too often ignored.
- **Key Concepts**:
	- Memory management in embedded C.
	- Interacting with hardware via drivers.
	- Writing safe and modular firmware
	- Interrupt service routines and callbacks.
