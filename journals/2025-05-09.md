- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]], starting out in Part 3 - Device Drivers and Communication Interfaces.
	- ## [[ARM Cortex-M]] [[Nested Vector Interrupt Controller]](NVIC)
		- The NVIC enables us to configure how interrupts shall behave, it even supports reconfiguration during run-time.
		- The [[NVIC]] is constructed in a way that the interrupt latency is significantly reduced.
		- An intterupt is not allowed to run twice in the same chain of handlers, ensuring that no loops are possible in the chain.
	- ## System Time
		- We almost alwyas need to track time in embedded sysetmes this is usually done by programmnig the [[microcontroller]] to generate an interrupt at regular intervals, which will move the system clock forward.
		- The [[phase-locked-loop]](PLL) is used to multiply an external clock source to the desired internal frequencies used by the [[CPU]] and [[integrated peripherals]].
		- The [[flash]] memory might be a bit slow to access when using [[execute-in-place]](XIP) so we might need to wait if the microprecessor runs at a high frequency, we setup the wait in the [[Access Control Register]](ACR).
		- Actual [[clock configuration]] is done in the [[Reset and Clock Control]](RCC) registers.
- Working on the course [[nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals]].
	- Got a warning that my [[Zephyr SDK]] is outdated. Learned that it could be updated via the [[nRF Toolchain Manager]]. Did not have the Toolchain Manager but it could be downloaded via [[nRF Connect for Desktop]]. But then the Toolchain Manager actually informed me to use [[VS Code]] instead (for version 3.01 of the [[nRF toolchain]]). Ended up resolving the warning inside VS Code by just choosing the tool chain version 3.01 and SDK version 3.01 again, not sure why this helped maybe some bug in the [[nRF Connect for VS Code Extension Pack]].
