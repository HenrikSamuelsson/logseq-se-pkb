- Reading in the book [[Just Enough Software Architecture]].
	- ### Section 1.7: Architecture for Agile Developers
		- [[Agile development]] focuses on building software effectively by prioritizing what is most valuable to the customer and delivering it first.
		- Agile practices aim to eliminate unnecessary work, and some agile developers believe that software architecture is not important.
		- However, the architectural strategies presented in the book can coexist with agile development for two main reasons:
			- **Just enough architecture.**  
			  The [[risk-driven model]] supports doing *just enough* architecture to mitigate key risks, followed by a coding session. This cycle repeats throughout the project.
			- **Conceptual model.**  
			  The book emphasizes strengthening your [[conceptual model]] — your mental framework for reasoning about software architecture — which benefits any development approach, including agile.
