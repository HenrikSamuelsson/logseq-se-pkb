    - Digital inputs on a [[microcontroller]] include a small internal circuit known as a [[Schmitt trigger]], which helps reliably detect whether the input is high or low.
    - If an input is left [[floating]] — meaning it is not connected to a known voltage level via external passive components — environmental noise can cause the voltage to hover near the logic threshold. This can lead to the Schmitt trigger switching frequently, causing unnecessary power consumption without providing meaningful input data.
    - To prevent this, the hardware design should include either internal or external pull-up or pull-down resistors:
      - **Pull-up**: Use when the default idle state should be high.
      - **Pull-down**: Use when the idle state should be low.
      - For **unused input pins**, either option is acceptable — the key is to avoid leaving them [[floating]].
      - Ensure that the internal resistor configuration does not conflict with any external resistor already in the design.
