- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]], today starting out in Part 4 - Multithreading.
  - [[Paralell Tasks]] and [[Scheduling]]
  - [[Trusted Execution Environment]](TEE)
   - ## [[Operating System]]
    - An *operating system* enables the **perceived parallel execution** of applications by rapidly switching between [[processes]] and [[threads]].
    - Even if the system has only a single [[CPU]] core that can execute only one thread at a time, the operating system uses [[scheduling]] to alternate execution, giving the illusion of concurrency.
    - Switching between tasks involves saving the current state (such as [[CPU registers]]) to [[RAM]] so that a task can be resumed later â€” this is known as *context switching*.
    - [[Context switching]] can follow different models:
      - In a *cooperative model*, each task **voluntarily yields** control of the [[CPU]].
      - In a *preemptive model*, the [[kernel]] uses **timer interrupts** to periodically interrupt running tasks and switch to others, which can occur at virtually any point during execution.
