- Reading in [[Embeddedd Systems Architecture]] about [[memory managemnt]], in particular about [[dynamic memory allocation]], the [[heeap]], [[malloc]], and [[free]].
	- An [[embedded system]] might not come with [[malloc]], and [[free]], one option is to make our own custom implementation that uses a contiguous area of physical memory, specified by the linker script. We then write our ownt malloc function that will mark sections as used, and a free function that will mark sections as unused.
	- Another option than to write our own version can be to use a utility library such as [[newlib]], that provides [[malloc]] and [[free]], but relies on a function called [[_sbrk]] being already avialble.
	- The [[heap]] is finite and after a certain number of [[malloc]] operations there will be a failure when attempting to allocate another time, the application must be able to handle this failure in a controlled way.
	- [[ARM Cortex-M]] can contain a [[MPU]] that can be setup with rules about how the memory is allowd to be used, if the rules are violated so will the MPU trigger a memory exception [[interrupt]], halting the execution. An example of a rule can be to have a [[guard region]] in the memory inbetween the heap and the stack that is not allowed to be used. If we have a [[stack overflow]] so will we write in the guard region and the MPU will detect this.
- Worked on the course [[nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals]].
	- Installed a new [[nRF SDK]], version 3.0.1,  stored it at location `c:\ncs\v3.0.1`.
