- üìò Bought the book [[Just Enough Software Architecture]] by [[George Fairbanks]].
  - üìç Platform [[Google Play Books]].
  - üìÑ Exported a PDF version.
  - üß† Summary:
    - Focuses on balancing formal architecture with agile development.
    - Advocates a **risk-driven** approach to decide how much architecture is needed.
    - Bridges the gap between code-level concerns and high-level design.
    - Emphasizes *just enough* modeling to address architectural risks without overengineering.
  - ## Chapter 1 Introduction
    - Software have continued to grow in size and complexity now being the largest and most complex things ever built.
    - The book discusses how to fight the complexity to come out victorious.
    - Evolution of [[Software engineering]] have helped to handle the complexity:
      - Moving from assembly to higher level languages.
      - The introduction of [[OOP]].
      - Softwar reuse through libraries and framworks.
    - Todays developers are not smarter or more skilled than any previous generations, but improved tools and strategies have made it possible scale up system intricacy.
    - Abstractions are also a weapon that is very good at handling complexity.
    - Abstractions enables a developer to lump togheter a lot of low level details greatly reducing the [[cognitive load]]
