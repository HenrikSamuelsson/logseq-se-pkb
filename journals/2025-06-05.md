- üìò Bought the book [[Just Enough Software Architecture]] by [[George Fairbanks]].
  - üìç Platform [[Google Play Books]].
  - üìÑ Exported a PDF version.
  - üß† Summary:
    - Focuses on balancing formal architecture with agile development.
    - Advocates a **risk-driven** approach to decide how much architecture is needed.
    - Bridges the gap between code-level concerns and high-level design.
    - Emphasizes *just enough* modeling to address architectural risks without overengineering.
 - ## Chapter 1: Introduction
  - Software has continued to grow in scale and intricacy, now being among the largest and most complex artifacts ever built.
  - The book discusses how to combat complexity and emerge victorious.
  - The evolution of [[Software engineering]] has helped manage this complexity:
    - Transitioning from assembly to higher-level languages.
    - The introduction of [[OOP]].
    - Software reuse through libraries and frameworks.
  - Today's developers are not necessarily more skilled than those of previous generations, but improved tools and strategies have enabled us to scale up system complexity.
  - [[Abstractions]] are a powerful tool for managing complexity.
  - Abstractions allow developers to group together many low-level details, significantly reducing [[cognitive load]].
