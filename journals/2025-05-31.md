- Reading the book **[[Engineering Manager's Handbook]]**
  - ## Engineering [[Leadership Style Archetypes]]
    - There are several classifications of leadership styles.
    - ### The Commander and the Servant
      - **Leadership purpose** has two opposites: **aligning** the team or **empowering** individuals in the team.
      - The *commander* focuses on aligning the team by setting a clear goal and telling them how to reach it.
      - The *servant* focuses on empowering individuals through support and creating opportunities.
    - ### The Coach and the Delegator
      - The **amount of guidance** provided by a leader will vary along a spectrum from **low to high**.
      - The *delegator* routes work to the right person and provides very little guidance.
      - The *coach* actively guides each individual team member.
    - ### The Communicator and the Co-Creator
      - The **source of vision** can originate solely from the **leader**’s personal opinions, or it can be an aggregate of opinions from the leader’s **network**.
      - A leader who focuses solely on sharing their own opinions and knowledge is known as a *communicator*.
      - A leader who focuses on collecting information from their network is known as a *co-creator*.
    - None of the leadership styles above are inherently good or bad—they simply fit better or worse depending on the situation.
