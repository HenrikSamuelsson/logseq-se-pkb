  - ## [[watchdog]]
    - The *watchdog* is an optional [[microcontroller]] feature designed to prevent the system from becoming stuck in an endless loop or unresponsive state, often due to [[software bugs]].
    - It is based on a special [[timer]] that counts down toward zero. If the timer reaches zero, the microcontroller is **automatically reset**.
    - To prevent this reset, dedicated code must **regularly reload** (know as "kicking" or "petting") the watchdog timer.
    - This reloading code should be **low priority** and must only run if the main application code is running correctly. This ensures that a malfunction in the main code (e.g., infinite loop or lockup) causes the watchdog to expire and reset the system.
