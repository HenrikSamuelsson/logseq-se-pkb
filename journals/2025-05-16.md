- Finished the chapter on [[Power Management]] in the book [[Embedded Systems Arcitecture]].
  - The author differentiates between four power modes commonly found in [[ARM]]-based microcontrollers:
    - [[Normal operation mode]]:
      The CPU and [[peripherals]] are active, managed through [[clock gating]]. The [[CPU clock]] runs at a high enough frequency to meet performance and latency requirements.
    - [[Sleep mode]] (also known as [[wait mode]]):
      The [[CPU clock]] is suspended, but [[peripherals]] remain active. The CPU can be awakened by an [[interrupt]], resuming execution in [[normal operation mode]].
    - [[Stop mode]]:
      Both the [[CPU clock]] and [[peripherals]] are deactivated. However, the contents of [[internal RAM]] and [[registers]] are preserved because the main [[voltage regulator]] remains on. Wake-up occurs via an [[interrupt]].
    - [[Standby mode]]:
      The [[CPU clock]], [[peripherals]], and [[voltage regulator]] are all turned off. [[Internal RAM]] content is lost. A backup domain or circuitry is used to wake up the system, which then requires a full boot sequence.
