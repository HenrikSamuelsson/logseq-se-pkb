- Reading in the book [[Embeddedd Systems Architecture]]\
  - ## [[UART]] Communication 
    - Looked at a basic [[C]] software for communication between a [[PC]] and a [[microcontroller]] via [[UART]], based on [[polling]].
    - A [[PC]] software called [[Minicom]] can be used to wiew [[UART]] data on [[Unix]]/[[Linux]] systems, being a [[serial terminal programs]] used to communicate with devices over serial interfaces like UART, often through [[USB-to-serial adapters]]. On [[Windows]] system we can instead used [[PuTTy]].
    - If there is some problem getting the [[UART]] communication running we can [[debug]] using a [[logic analyzer]], that can capture the traffic and also decoding the [[data stream]] for us.
    - At the end of the section there was a draft of a [[C]] software for handling a [[UART]] using [[interrupts]], as opposed to [[polling]].
