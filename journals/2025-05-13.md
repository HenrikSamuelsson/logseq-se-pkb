  - ## [[UART]] Communication 
    - Looked at a basic [[C]] software for communication between a [[PC]] and a [[microcontroller]] via [[UART]], based on [[polling]].
    - A [[PC]] software called [[Minicom]] can be used to wiew [[UART]] data on [[Unix]]/[[Linux]] systems, being a [[serial terminal programs]] used to communicate with devices over serial interfaces like UART, often through [[USB-to-serial adapters]]. On [[Windows]] system we can instead used [[PuTTy]].
    - If there is some problem getting the [[UART]] communication running we can [[debug]] using a [[logic analyzer]], that can capture the traffic and also decoding the [[data stream]] for us.
    - At the end of the section there was a draft of a [[C]] software for handling a [[UART]] using [[interrupts]], as opposed to [[polling]].
  -  ## [[SPI]] Communication
    - Based on a [[master-slave]] relation.
    - Includes a [[clock signal]] making the communication synchronous, which opens up for higher speed than [[UART]].
    - The bus can be shared, an addtional [[slave select]] signal for each slave is used to choose the currently active communication duo.
    - The [[STM32F407DISCOVERY]] board has an [[accelerometer]] connected to the SPI1 bus, a program to communicate with thin was presented.
    - [[SPI]] communication will rely on that the master sends extra dummy bytes to keep the clock running while the slave outputs responses.
    - If there is some problem with [[SPI]] communication we can [[debug]] using a [[logic analyzer]].
