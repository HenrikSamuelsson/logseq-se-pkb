- Continued reading in [[Embedded Systems Architecture]]. Today it was about:
    - [[startup_code]] this is code that runs before a system enters the [[main_function]].
    - [[fault_handlers]] that takes care of fault-realted events triggered by the CPU in case of execution errors.
    - [[configurable_fault_status_register]] (CFSR) are special registers in [[cortex_m3]]/[[cortex_m4]] with data that aid in debugging faults.
