- Continued reading in [[Embedded Systems Architecture]]. Today it was about:
	- [[startup_code]] this is code that runs before a system enters the [[main_function]].
	- [[fault_handlers]] that takes care of fault-realted events triggered by the CPU in case of execution errors.
	- [[configurable_fault_status_register]] (CFSR) are special registers in [[cortex_m3]]/[[cortex_m4]] with data that aid in debugging faults.
- Worked on the course [[nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals]], Lesson 1 - Exercise 1.
	- Downloaded new [[Segger J-link]] Software and Documentation pack, V8.30.
	- Downloaded [[nrfutil]] and stored it under `C:\tools\nrf`, also added this to my `PATH`.
	- Tested to upgrade [[nrfutil]], but it was already up-to-date:
	  ```console
	  ```
	- Installed the `nrfutil device` command:
	  ```console
	  C:\Users\Henrik>nrfutil install device
	  [00:00:17] ###### 100% [Install packages] Install packages
	  ```
	- Next step was to install [[VS Code]] but no need since I already have it. Planned to create a nRF profile but turned out I already had started on one.
	- Installed the [[nRF Connect for VS Code Extension Pack]].
	- Installed  new [[nRF toolchain]] in [[VS Code]], by activating nRF Connect view and then choosing Manage toolchains, went with v3.0.1.
