- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]].
	- A [[bootloader]] is a special software that runs breifly at startup before the main [[application]], as part of a mechanisms to support remote update of the system.
	- More powerful [[ARM]] processors will have a [[Vector Table Offset Register]](VTOR), located at address `0xE00ED08`. This register makes it possible to specify an offset for the [[IV]] at run time, making it possible to have one IV for the [[bootloader]] and another for the application.
	- [[objcopy]] can be used to pad the free space in [[flash]] between the [[bootloader]] and the [[application]] with a defined content, such as all [[0xFF]], making the bootloader always having a defined known size. We can then concatenate the bootloader and application togehether into a single [[.elf]].
	- A [[bootloader]] should support [[security]], which takes effort to implement, a shortcut can be to use existing open source projects such as [[wolfBoot]].
