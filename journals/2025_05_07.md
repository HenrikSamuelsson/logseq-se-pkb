  - A [[bootloader]] is a special software that runs breifly at startup before the main [[application]], as part o a mechanisms to support remote update of the system.
  - More powerful [[ARM]] processors will have a [[Vector Table Offset Register]](VTOR), located at address `0xE00ED08`. This register makes it possible to specify an offset for the [[IV]] at run time, making it possible to have one IV for the [[bootloader]] and another for the application.
