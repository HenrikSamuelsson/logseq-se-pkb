- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]].
	- [[GDB]] is a [[command line tool]] used for [[debugging]], it comes as a part of the [[GCC]] suite. We can directly inspect the program flow and see memory content and [[CPU registers]] using this tool.
	- An embedded project can be started with either a simple [[text editor]] or an [[IDE]]. In an [[IDE]] more of the work tend to be automated and settings are done through navigating in a [[GUI]]. Working with [[text editor]] is based on writing everything by hand in a text file, such as [[linker scripts]] and then provide the text files as input to [[command line tool]]s.
	  Both ways of working have its own merits. [[IDE]]s offer convenience and speed for getting started, especially with complex microcontrollers. In contrast, text editors give you fine-grained control and are better suited for seasoned developers who want deeper insight into their [[toolchain]] and [[portability]].
	- A prominent component of embedded systems development is the [[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain]], which is distributed as part of the [[GCC]] toolchain.
	  The toolchain comes in different variants described by triplet names, for example [[arm-none-eabi]], meaning produce objects for [[ARM]], no specific support for an operating system, and with the embedded [[ABI]].
	  Part of the toolchain is [[cross compiler]] [[Arm-none-eabi-gcc]] that can compile [[C]] code into [[machine code]] for several different [[target]]s.
	  For example to compile for a [[ARM Cortex M4]] the compiler would be invoked like this:
	  ```console
	  $ arm-none-eabi-gcc -c test.c -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4
	  ```
	- A **prominent component** of embedded systems development is the [[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain]], which is distributed as part of the [[GCC]] toolchain.
	  
	  This toolchain comes in different variants identified by *triplet names*, such as `[[arm-none-eabi]]`. This indicates:
	  * **arm**: The target architecture is [[ARM]]
	  * *none**: No specific support for an operating system
	  * *eabi**: Uses the embedded [[ABI]] (Application Binary Interface)
		- One of the main tools in this toolchain is the [[cross compiler]] [[arm-none-eabi-gcc]], which can compile [[C]] code into [[machine code]] for various embedded [[target]]s.
		  
		  For example, to compile code for an [[ARM Cortex M4]], the compiler might be invoked like this:
		  
		  ```console
		  $ arm-none-eabi-gcc -c test.c -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4
		  ```
	- [[newlib]] is a C library that provides a lightweight subset of the [[C Standard Library]], designed to be useful in embedded systems that operate in a [[freestanding environment in C]]. It includes core functionality such as `printf`, `malloc`, and string handling, but omits features that depend on an operating system or file system.
- Restarted taking the course [[nRF Connect SDK fundamentals]]. Have already taken the course once but feel that I need to deepen my understanding on the concepts and also ensure that my nRF development environment is setup correctly.
	- Started on Lesson 1 - nRF Connect SDK Introduction
