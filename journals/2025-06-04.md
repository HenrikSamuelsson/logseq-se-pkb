  - ## Project Planning
    - Project planning refers to the activities related to preparing for a project:
      - Scoping, budgeting, estimation, prioritization, timelines, roadmaps, setting milestones, etc.
    - An important reason for project planning is to avoid misunderstandings and unpleasant surprises later, when the project is already well underway or nearly completed.
    - The goal is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on the expected outcomes **before** starting the actual work.
    - ### Estimation
    - Estimation is only easy if already having done a very similar project, or if the work is small but then you do not really need to launch a project at all.
    - More effort should be put into estimation if the deadline is hard, like building something that will be part of an event that is imovvable in time.
    - For a feautere that is non negotiable but with no hard deadline it can better to reduce effort spent on estimation and just get started faster.
    - For projects with requirments that are not set in stone we can discuss/negotiate during the estimation phase to compromise between number of features and getting the project done on time.
