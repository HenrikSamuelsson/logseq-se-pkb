  - ## Project Planning
    - Project planning refers to the activities related to preparing for a project:
      - Scoping, budgeting, estimation, prioritization, timelines, roadmaps, setting milestones, etc.
    - An important reason for project planning is to avoid misunderstandings and unpleasant surprises later, when the project is already well underway or nearly completed.
    - The goal is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on the expected outcomes **before** starting the actual work.
   - ### Estimation Insights
    - Estimation is only easy when:
      - You've done a very similar project before, **or**
      - The scope of work is very small (in which case, it might not even qualify as a full project).
    - More effort should go into estimation when the **deadline is hard**, such as:
      - Projects tied to fixed events or immovable launch dates.
    - For a **must-have feature** with **no strict deadline**, it's often better to:
      - Reduce time spent on estimation.
      - Start implementation sooner and adapt as needed.
    - When the **requirements are flexible**, the estimation phase can be used to:
      - Negotiate a balance between scope (number of features) and delivery time.
      - Align expectations across stakeholders regarding possible trade-offs.
