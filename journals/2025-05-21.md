- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]], today on the topic of [[Real-time scheduling]].
- ## [[Real-time scheduling]]
  - *Real-time scheduling* is required when there is a need to react to events within a **short and predictable amount of time**.
  - These systems have timing constraints, including **deadlines**, which specify when a task must **start** or **complete** its execution.
  - One common strategy is static [[priority-driven preemptive scheduling]], where the most important tasks are assigned higher [[priority]], allowing them to **preempt** lower-priority tasks.
  - Another widely used approach is [[Earliest Deadline First]] (EDF), a **dynamic scheduling** method where the task with the **closest deadline** is selected to run next.
  - Blocking occurs when a task waits passively (without consuming CPU) for an external event or resource (e.g., I/O, semaphore, or message). Managing blocking behavior is critical in real-time systems to ensure tasks still meet their timing guarantees.
