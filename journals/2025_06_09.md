- Reading in the book [[Just Enough Software Architecture]].
	- ## Chapter 2: Software Architecture
	- 🎯 **Purpose of the chapter**: Lay the foundation for understanding how **risk** relates to **software architecture**.
	- 🏗️ **What is software architecture?**
		- It's the **design of the system** that affects key **quality attributes** like performance, security, and modifiability.
		- Architecture is largely **orthogonal to functionality**, meaning the same functionality can often be achieved using different architectures.
	- 🧱 **Why architecture matters**:
		- Acts as the **skeleton** of the system.
		- **Constrains and shapes** the system's properties.
		- Influences long-term **maintainability** and system qualities.
	- ⚠️ **When architecture becomes critical**:
		- Solution space is **small**, with only a few viable ways forward due to factors such as:
			- **Strict constraints** (e.g., real-time deadlines, memory limits)
			- **High performance or security demands**
			- **Legacy integration requirements**
			- **Highly novel or unprecedented goals**
		- **High risk** of failure.
		- **Demanding quality attribute** requirements.
		- **Unfamiliar domains** or innovative projects.
	- 🛠️ **Three levels of architectural engagement**:
		- **Architecture-indifferent**: Minimal attention; relies on standard, precedented solutions (e.g., classic 3-tier IT apps).
		- **Architecture-focused**: Intentional selection of architecture aligned with system goals.
		- **Architecture hoisting**: Design architecture specifically to enforce a desired property (e.g., scalability, safety).
