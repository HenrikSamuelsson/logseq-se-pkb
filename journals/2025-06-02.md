- Reading in the book [[Engineering Manageer's Handbook]]
  - ## Chapter 4 â€“ Leading Architecture
    - The book offers a very concise definition of [[software architecture]] that I quite like:
      - > [[Software architecture]] is the **process** and **product** of creating technical **system designs**.
  - Good architecture pays for itself by providing important support to the team.
  - The right architecture helps the team stay focused on business goals and prevents distractions.
  - An engineering manager may sometimes hold both the managerial and software architect roles.
  - Smaller companies might lack formal processes for architectural system design, placing additional responsibility on the engineering manager.
  - Larger companies typically have mature processes for system design and supporting functions; here, the engineering manager will focus more on coordination and monitoring.
  - The system design process can be split into two main parts:
    - ### 1. Gathering Information
      - TODO
    - ### 2. Making Decisions
      - TODO
