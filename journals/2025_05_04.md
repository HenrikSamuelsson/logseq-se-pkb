- Reading about the binary format conversion in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]].
	- There is a tool in the [[arm-none-eabi]] toolchain called [[objcopy]], that takes on [[object file]] e.g [[.elf]], [[.o]] and creates another version of this file in a different format.
	- Convert [[.elf]] to [[.bin]] (plain binary):
	  ```console
	  $ arm-non-eabi-objcopy -I elf -O binary image.elf image.bin
	  ```
	- This will strip away header data from the [[.elf]] that is not needed to run on the target.
	- Related to [[objcopy]] there is another tool called [[objdump]], that displays human readable details about the [[image]] .
	- [[Disassemble]] machine code using [[objdump]]
	  ```console
	  arm-none-eabi-objdump -d -image.elf
	  ```
- Reading about interacting with the [[target]] in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]].
	- For [[embedded systems]] development, we interact with the [[target]] via a [[JTAG]] or [[SWD]] interface. These communication channels allow software to be uploaded to the [[target]]â€™s [[flash]] memory and provide access to [[debugging]] functionality.
	- In practice, this interaction is mediated by a hardware adapter placed between the [[host]] and the [[target]]. The host is typically a PC, with the adapter connecting to it via [[USB]]. The adapter's other end uses a specialized cable and connector that plugs into a dedicated header on the [[PCB]] where the target [[microcontroller]] is mounted.
	- One tool to access [[JTAG]]/[[SWD]] functionalities is the Open On-Chip Debugger ([[OpenOCD]]).
