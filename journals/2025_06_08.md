- Reading in the book [[Just Enough Software Architecture]].
	- ### Section 1.8: About this Book
		- Focus of the book will be **construction of software**, [[soft skills]] for architects is omitted .
		- The book is divided into two part:
			- Part I: **[[Risk-driven Software Architecture]]**
				- TODO
				- ## üìò Part I: Risk-driven Software Architecture
					- Software architecture is hard to define precisely but has key characteristics:
						- Acts as the **skeleton** of a system.
						- Is **orthogonal to functionality**.
						- Strongly influences **quality attributes**.
						- Relies on **abstractions** and **constraints**.
					- Architecture is most critical when:
						- The **solution space is small**.
						- **Failure risks are high**.
						- **Demanding quality attributes** are required.
					- There are different approaches to design:
						- **Architecture-indifferent**
						- **Architecture-focused**
						- **Architecture hoisting**
					- ‚úÖ **Risk-driven model** steps:
					  1. Identify and prioritize **risks**.
					  2. Select and apply appropriate **techniques**.
					  3. Evaluate **risk reduction**.
					- üìå Example (Chapter 4): Home Media Player
						- Challenges: team communication, COTS integration, metadata consistency.
			- Part II: **[[Architecture Modeling]]**
				- Second part is about building a [[Conceptual Model]] of Software Architecture.
					- Goal: Develop a strong **mental model** of software architecture.
					- Introduces the **canonical model structure**:
						- **[[Domain model]]** ‚Üí Real-world entities and concepts.
						- **[[Design model]]** ‚Üí Structure and behaviour of the software.
						- **[[Code model]]** ‚Üí Actual source code.
					- üìê Use **[[views]]** to highlight specific aspects of a system.
						- Views can be grouped into **viewtypes** for clarity.
					- üîí Emphasizes **encapsulation boundaries**:
						- Hides internal workings to reduce cognitive load.
						- Enables independent evolution of components.
						- Requires effective interface and isolation techniques.
					- üß∞ Consolidates proven **architectural abstractions** and **modeling techniques**:
						- Focuses on both **quality attributes** and **functionality**.
						- Covers pragmatic modeling and **debugging of models**.
					- ‚ö†Ô∏è Also warns about **pitfalls** when applying modeling techniques.
					- üß† Outcome: A **rich conceptual model** to understand systems like a coach sees a game ‚Äî with strategy, structure, and clarity.
