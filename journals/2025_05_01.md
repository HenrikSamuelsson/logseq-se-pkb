- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]] by [[Daniele Lacamera]] and adding some notes to this personal knowledge base.
- Currently in chapter 1 called Embedded Systems - A Pragmatic Approach.
- [[Lacamera]] divides embedded systems into three different categories:
	- [[Embedded Linux systems]].
	- Low end [[8-bit microcontrollers]].
	- Middle range microcontrollers allowing for more advanced [[system programming]], typically a [[32-bit microcontrollers]]. It this type that is the focused on in the book.
- More advanced computer systems—such as desktops, smartphones, and [[Embedded Linux systems]]—typically include a [[memory management unit]] ([[MMU]]). The MMU handles the translation between [[virtual memory addresses]] and [[physical memory addresses]], allowing for memory protection and task isolation. In contrast, middle-range microcontrollers often lack an MMU, which makes it more difficult to isolate tasks—meaning a single misbehaving process can corrupt the entire system.
- Learned about a mechanism known as [[Execute In Place]] [[(XIP)]], which allows the [[processor]] to directly fetch and execute instructions from [[flash]] memory without copying them to [[RAM]]. This is made possible because flash is memory-mapped to a fixed address in the system’s address space, enabling sequential instruction execution without intermediate buffering.
- It should be noted that while [[flash]] memory is typically readable by the [[processor]] byte-by-byte, it is not writable in the same straightforward way. Writing to flash generally requires a block-based approach: a whole block must be erased before new data can be written. This erase-before-write characteristic adds complexity to modifying flash contents. Updating flash during runtime is known as [[In-Application Programming]] ([[IAP]]).
