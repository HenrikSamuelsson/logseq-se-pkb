- Started a new project [[CoreR4]] where I will be working at a low level with the [[Arduino Uno R4 WIFI]].
	- Created a [[GitHub]] repository for the [[CoreR4]] project:
		- https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/core-r4
	- Created a dedicated profile for this in [[VS Code]], simply called CoreR4.
	- Started a conversation about the project with [[ChatGPT]], called this CoreR4.
	- Took the decision to start out using [[make]] as [[build system]].
