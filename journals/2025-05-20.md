- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]] about [[parallell tasks]] and [[Scheduling]].
  -  ## Attribute `naked` (GCC)
  -  The ` __attribute__((naked))` is a **GCC-specific attribute** that tells the compiler **not to generate** [[prologue]] **and** [[epilogue]] code for a function.
  -  Using ` __attribute__((naked))` means that the function will have **no automatic savin/restoring of registers or stack frame setup**.
  -  The  `__attribute__((naked))` is needed in [[low-level embedded programming]] for example to write [[context switching]] code in a [[scheduler]].
  -  If using the [[IAR C/C++ compiler]], the equivalent keyword is `__naked`.
