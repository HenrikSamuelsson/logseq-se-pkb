- Reading in the book [[Embedded Systems Architecture]], today starting out in chapter 11 [[Trusted Execution Environment]].
  - ## [[Trusted Execution Environment]] (TEE)
    - A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) refers to a secure area within a processor or microcontroller that ensures confidentiality and integrity of code and data.
    - It enables the separation of the execution domain into two (or more) isolated domains:
      -  Trusted software that runs with full capabilities and permissions.
      -  Non-trusted software, which is restricted and cannot interfere with the trusted side.
    - This architecture helps protect against attacks such as [[privilege escalation]] or [[code injection]] and is commonly used in [[secure boot]], cryptographic operations, and [[DRM]].
    - On microcontrollers, TEEs are typically supported via hardware extensions such as ARM TrustZone for Cortex-M.
