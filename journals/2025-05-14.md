  - [I2C] Bus
    - [[I2C]] is a serial communication protocol, like [[UART]] and [[SPI]].
    - [[I2C]] is more similar to [[SPI]] than it is to [[UART]] being a [[synchronous]] protocol with a [[master slave]] setup and a [[clock line]].
    - The master adress the slave it shall communicate with, each slave on the bus must use an unique address.
    - Multi master setup is supported.
    - Many microcontrollers will have come with one more [[I2C controller]]s built in.
